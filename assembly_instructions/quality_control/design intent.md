# Design intent

## Plastic selection
The prefered material to print the plastic parts from is ABS. If it is not possible to use ABS then PETG is also acceptable. PLA is not an acceptable material because it does not withstand exposure to UV light or exposure to the elements well.

## Windlass shape
As explained [here](https://trklou.medium.com/reinventing-3d-printed-tourniquets-for-ukraine-is-a-mistake-be2937f0ad65) the windlass must remain cylindrical in shape. This shape does present some inconvenience while printing but this is unavoidable. Putting a flat face on the windlass will cause the effective diameter of the windlass will not be constant during tightening of the tourniquet. This adds multiple seconds to the time required to apply the tourniquet which is unacceptable.
