# Design intent

## Plastic selection - do not use PLA
The prefered material to print the plastic parts from is ABS. If it is not possible to use ABS then PETG is also acceptable. PLA is not an acceptable material because it does not withstand exposure to UV light or exposure to the elements well.

## Windlass shape
The windlass must remain cylindrical in shape. This shape does present some inconvenience while printing but this is unavoidable. Support material should be used when printing. Putting a flat face on the windlass will cause the effective diameter of the windlass to not be constant during tightening of the tourniquet. This adds multiple seconds to the time required to apply the tourniquet which is unacceptable.

## Do not change the clip thickness
If the thickness of the clip is changed it will negativley impact the ability of the windlass to secure properly.

## Keep the backing plate and clip separate.
This is important to accomidate small limb sizes. Keeping the parts separate also makes it easier to print.

## Use sections of hook and loop instead of one length.
This allows the TQ to dependably catch on itself when applied one-handed.

## Adhere to the inner-strap-through-windlass length when assembling.
Changing this length negativley impacts the ability of the windlass to apply effective pressure against a wound.
